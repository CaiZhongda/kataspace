This is a simple interactive, multi-user, 3D, online application,
based on KataJS and Sirikata.

Client
------
The code in this repository, along with KataJS, included as an
submodule, is a full client for Sirikata-based worlds. Because we rely
on KataJS, which in turn relies on other libraries, there's quite a
bit of initialization.  This should all be wrapped up nicely in the
Makefile, so simply typing

make

in this directory should make sure all the libraries are up to date
and built. This application must then be served by a web server.  A
convenient way to do that is to run

./externals/katajs/contrib/lighttpd.py

from this directory, which uses lighttp to serve this directory from
localhost:8888.  To view the application, enter

http://localhost:8888/static/

into your browser.

Server
------
To interact with other users we connect to a Sirikata space server.
See http://sirikata.com for details.  If you want to set up a server
to connect to, download the code for Sirikata and build the space
server. Using the minimal set of dependencies is sufficient because
only the server component is used -- KataJS provides the client-side
code for connecting to a Sirikata space.

Once you have the code, simply run the space server
(sirikata/build/cmake/space, append _d for the debug version). The
appropriate ports are hard-coded into the application to work with the
defaults.  If you need to use different ports, or want to point to a
server other than localhost, make the appropriate changes in index.html.
